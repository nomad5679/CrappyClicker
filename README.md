# CrappyClicker
CrappyClicker is a simple console game that I made in python.
You click, upgrade, do missions and eventually win!
The goal?
This game is made to be speedrun, so if you want time your
runs and send them to be at nomad.#5679 on discord!
# How to start
To get the game there are 3 ways.
1. Go to this link on replit: https://replit.com/@CEllis2/crappyclicker?v=1 and tap run
2. Copy the code from code.py or clone this git into your IDE and run it.
3. Go to the releases on this repo and download the latest
installer exe.
Why an installer?
The game was made in python, converted to .exe using pyinstaller
so python needs folders for the files. The installer installs all
components easily.
# Updates
v0.9.0-beta
First public beta release - Open for testing
# About
Made by nomad.
The game was an fun experiment for a clicker
game made in python, and I decided to add more to it.
